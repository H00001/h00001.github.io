     ttaasskkggaatteedd is a system daemon that implements a policy for the
     task_for_pid system service.  When the kernel is asked for the task port
     of a process, and preliminary access control checks pass, it invokes this
     daemon (via launchd) to make the decision.

              The daemon will quit after that many seconds of inactivity. It
              will be relaunched by launchd as needed. A timeout of zero can
              be specified to make the daemon quit after servicing each
              request, but a small positive timeout is better for performance.

     --ii _p_i_d   Inject the service port of ttaasskkggaatteedd into the process with the
              given pid, rather than relying on launchd to install it system-
              wide. This is for testing only, and requires the launchd config-
              uration for ttaasskkggaatteedd to be removed.

                    wants access to task ports. A value of "safe" bypasses
                    authorization checks if so configured.  Code must be
                    signed by any system-trusted signing authority.

     ttaasskkggaatteedd was first introduced in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard).

     Procmod and procview support (-p) was removed in 10.11.

     Certain software updates of Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) introduced the convention
     requiring membership in the procmod or procview groups to control task
     port access. Before that, any process could obtain the task port of any
     other process with the same user-id.
